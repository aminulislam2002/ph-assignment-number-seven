            </h3>
            Answer:
            <p>
              <span>.map()</span> methods is used to executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new
              array with the selected updated elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>.filter()</span> methods is used to checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain
              criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>.forEach()</span> methods is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not
              change the array and it will not returns anything
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>.find()</span> is used to returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided
              testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

          <p>
            The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single
            thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
            <br />
            <span>Call Starck:</span> Keeps track of all the operations in line to be execute. Whenever a function is
            finished, it is popped from the stack.
            <br />
            <span>Event Queue:</span> Sends new functions to the stack for processing. Follows the queue data structure.
            Maintains the currect sequence in whice all operations should be sent for executions.
